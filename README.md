# Predictive Analytics

## Prediction of Fetal Outcome During Labor and Delivery

In this course of predictive analytics, the capstone project was designed to take a product from inception to implementation.  The dataset chosen was Fetal Cardiotocography or Fetal Heart Rate Tracings.  When a woman goes into labor, a set of standard protocols are enacted and during labor, the infant's heart rate is continually monitored for patterns that could be indicative of distress where intervention would be required.

This database is also from University of California-Irvine Machine Learning Repository and consists of technical measurements of fetal heart tracings.  The target variable was to predict whether a heart rate tracing was normal, suspect (potentially requiring intervention), or pathologic (intervention is immediately required).  The three machine learning algorithms used were K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, and Random Forest Modeling.  Predictive accuracy was primarily judged using Precision, Recall, and F1 scores due to imbalanced classes.

#### In this case, the project was divided with an R based exploratory data analysis portion and a Python-based machine learning algorithm implementation portion.
